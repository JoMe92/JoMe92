## ◆ About Me

I am a **Senior Development Engineer** focusing on **Machine Learning** and **software development for industrial applications**.  
With a background in **Technical Physics** (Munich University of Applied Sciences), I combine analytical precision with a system-level understanding of how data, software, and hardware interact.

I work at the intersection of **machine learning, edge computing, and production automation**, building maintainable, interpretable, and production-ready AI systems.  
My experience covers the entire ML lifecycle — from dataset curation to deployment and monitoring — with an emphasis on MLOps, edge inference, and human-centered AI.

Recent work includes:
- Developing **No-Code MLOps software** that enables engineers to train and deploy models without dedicated ML expertise  
- Building **real-time inference pipelines** on **NVIDIA Jetson** (PyTorch → ONNX/TensorRT)  
- Implementing **industrial vision systems** (OCR, detection, segmentation, 3D) with CI/CD and on-prem infrastructure  
- Establishing **responsible AI and GenAI guidelines** for secure industrial use  
- Exploring **LLMs** for integration into structured ML pipelines and explainable workflows  

My professional interests include:
- Applied ML and computer vision for quality assurance and manufacturing  
- Edge AI, inference optimization, and model lifecycle automation  
- MLOps tooling for reproducibility and monitoring  
- Human-centered and explainable AI for industrial adoption
